# Data-Engineering-ML-Intro

This notebook is intended to be used as teaching material for those who want initialy exposure to data engineering and machine learning. 
We go through basic data ingestion, pre-processing, organizing our data in the medallion lakeouse architecture (bronze, silverm, and gold layers), 
and some very basic machine learning.

STATUS:This is still a work in progress
